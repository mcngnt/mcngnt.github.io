                    <p>Hi ! My name is Martin Cuingnet and I am a MVA (Mathématiques Vision Apprentissage) student at ENS Paris-Saclay.
                    My main research interest is AI, especially around LLMs and other Transformer like architecture.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    I have completed several projects related to these topics, most notably during my bachelor’s and master’s internships. In my bachelor’s internship, I focused on the mechanistic interpretability of Transformer models in the context of turn-based conversations. During my master’s internship, I developed an LLM-based web agent specifically designed with lifelong learning in mind. You can find more details in the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> section.
