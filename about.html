                    <p>Hi ! My name is Martin Cuingnet and I am M1 MPRI Computer Science student at the ENS Paris-Saclay.
                    My main research interest is Artificial Intelligence, especially AI Alignement and about the Transformer's architecture for the moment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have previously done an internship working on Transformer models used for turn-prediction in conversation. My work was espcially focused on mechanistic interpretability of such models (you can find more details in the <a href="projects.html">projets</a> sections).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You can also find my <a href="cv.html">CV</a> and other <a href="projects.html">projets</a> that I made over the years.</p>
